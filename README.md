# Movie Reviews

With the IMDb dataset with over 50,000 movie reviews, I created a Logistic model that is optimized to predict the sentiment of a movie review

## Installation

Open your terminal, then copy & paste the command in your desired directory location

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andrew011002/Movie-Reviews.git
```

## Running
Open the prediction.py file, run the file, enter your review then see what the model thinks of your review!
